# Project Templates

## Read This When

- Bootstrapping a new project with the full guardrail stack
- Wanting ready-to-use CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, hooks, and rules
- Reviewing the recommended agent architecture as a concrete example

## Default Recommendation

- Start from the unified default template in `templates/`.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` as the shared core and `CLAUDE.md` as the thin Claude-specific layer.
- Use hooks for deterministic enforcement and rules for path-scoped guidance.
- Follow the simplest proving-slice workflow from the templates instead of broad first-pass rewrites.
- Implement the stack in stages so each layer is proven before the next is added.

## Use This Pattern

## Canonical Template Stack

The recommended default stack is:

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript strict mode
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui + Lucide + Geist
- Drizzle + PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Vercel AI SDK + model providers behind explicit policy
- Zod 4
- Biome
- Vitest + Playwright smoke
- Vercel by default unless user constraints say otherwise

## What Is In The Template

```
templates/
├── AGENTS.md
├── CLAUDE.md
└── .claude/
    ├── settings.json
    ├── hooks/
    │   ├── lint-changed.sh
    │   ├── test-on-change.sh
    │   ├── block-destructive.sh
    │   └── quality-gate-reminder.sh
    └── rules/
        ├── app-routes.md
        ├── components.md
        ├── database.md
        └── testing.md
```

## How The Pieces Fit Together

```
AGENTS.md (~80 lines, shared by Claude + Codex)
  ├─ project context, stack, commands
  ├─ workflow: simplest proving slice first, test immediately, commit each proving slice
  ├─ quality gates
  ├─ build order by stage
  └─ hard rules, naming, decision points
        │
CLAUDE.md (~25 lines, Claude-specific)
  ├─ @AGENTS.md import
  ├─ Claude habits: subagents, /clear, dummy-happy-path-first
  ├─ ask-the-user rule for meaningful tradeoffs
  ├─ documents which hooks are active
  └─ explicit prohibitions
        │
.claude/rules/ (loaded on demand when matching paths are read)
  ├─ domain-specific rules scoped to file patterns
  └─ keeps global instruction count low
        │
.claude/settings.json (hooks — deterministic enforcement)
  ├─ PostToolUse → lint the changed file
  ├─ PostToolUse → run the related test
  ├─ PreToolUse  → block destructive commands
  └─ Stop        → remind about quality gates
```

This follows the enforcement pyramid from [agent-instruction-design](agent-instruction-design.md):

1. **Hooks enforce** what must always happen (lint, targeted test, block danger)
2. **CLAUDE.md advises** on workflow and architecture
3. **Rules scope** domain knowledge to the files that need it

The intended development loop is:

1. make the simplest slice that proves the workflow
2. run the narrowest relevant test immediately
3. fix failures before expanding scope
4. run broader checks at slice boundaries
5. commit each coherent passing slice

The intended expansion pattern is:

1. get one dummy happy-path workflow working
2. prove it with the smallest meaningful test
3. only then apply the pattern to adjacent files, edge cases, and broader code paths

## Using The Templates

Copy the unified template into a new project:

```bash
cp templates/AGENTS.md /path/to/new-project/
cp templates/CLAUDE.md /path/to/new-project/
cp -r templates/.claude /path/to/new-project/
chmod +x /path/to/new-project/.claude/hooks/*.sh
```

Then customise:

1. Update `AGENTS.md` project section with the actual project description
2. Update commands to match real `package.json` scripts
3. Remove stages the project does not need yet, but keep the order
4. Adjust path-scoped rules for the actual directory layout
5. Add project-specific rules to `CLAUDE.md` prohibitions
6. Test each hook by triggering its event manually

## Commands / Config

Typical setup steps:

- copy the unified template
- make hooks executable
- update commands to match the real project
- test hooks manually before relying on them

## Staged Build Order

The template is intentionally layered. Implement in this order:

1. strict TypeScript, Biome, and one route
2. Zod validation and one passing unit test
3. one UI path with Tailwind + shadcn/ui
4. one database schema and one proven read/write path
5. one AI flow on a dummy happy path
6. one Playwright smoke test
7. deploy and CI

Each stage should be proven before the next is added.

## User Questions

Where there are real options, the agent should ask the user one concise question before committing.

Ask about:

- deployment target if the org already has a cloud standard
- database hosting/provider choice
- whether pgvector is needed now or later
- which model vendor is allowed or preferred

Default toward:

- stricter typing
- more runtime validation
- stronger deterministic guardrails
- simpler safe workflows before broader automation

## Design Decisions

### Why AGENTS.md is the main file

AGENTS.md is read by both Claude Code (via `@AGENTS.md` import) and OpenAI Codex (natively). Putting shared instructions here means the same rules apply regardless of which agent runs.

CLAUDE.md adds only Claude-specific behavior: subagent usage, context management, hook documentation, and explicit prohibitions.

### Why hooks, not CLAUDE.md rules

Every CLAUDE.md instruction costs a slot in the ~100-150 instruction budget. Rules like "always lint after editing" are better enforced by a PostToolUse hook that runs automatically. This saves instruction budget for things only advisory text can express (architectural decisions, naming, workflow).

### Why path-scoped rules

Global rules compete for attention with every other instruction. Path-scoped rules in `.claude/rules/` load only when Claude reads files in matching directories — keeping context lean and relevant.

### Hook design principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Fast feedback | Lint and test hooks run the smallest relevant checks first |
| No false blocks | PostToolUse hooks exit 0 always — they inform, they cannot block |
| Explicit danger list | PreToolUse block-destructive uses an allowlist of known-bad patterns |
| Prompt on ambiguity | `pulumi up` gets `"ask"` (user confirms), not `"deny"` (blocked) |
| Proving-slice workflow | Instructions explicitly prefer the simplest passing slice that proves the workflow |
| Dummy-workflow-first | Templates tell agents to prove one toy happy path before generalizing |
| Quality reminder | Stop hook checks for a recent passing slice, not just generic activity |

## Pitfalls

- Do not add hook scripts to `.gitignore` — they are shared team configuration.
- Do not make hooks slow — timeouts cause silent failures (30s for lint, 60s for test).
- Do not use Stop hook with exit 2 to force more output — it prevents Claude from finishing.
- Do not duplicate linter rules in CLAUDE.md — the hook runs the linter, the linter has the rules.
- Do not forget `chmod +x` on hook scripts after copying.
